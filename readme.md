Hello!  This is a REALLY simple command line tool that converts between celcius and fahrenheit.  This is literally so I can understand what the hell my wife is talking about when she says it's "hot" outside because it's 30 degrees.  Anyway, I set up an alias in my `.zshrc` so I can just type `temp f 100` and it will return `37.78C`, or I can enter `temp c 100` and it will return `212.0F`.  That's it.  It doesn't do anything else, and I don't anticipate expanding it's features to do anything else.
